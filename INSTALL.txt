Gedit(version-3.22.1) already has a Makefile of its own. Hence, for the new files created as a requirement for word completion purposes, lines have been added to this already existing Makefile for the respective files (splchk_functions.c, splchk_functions.h,gedit-word-selector.c and gedit-word-selector.h) for their compilation.
Therefore, the executable name would be 'gedit' whose default location would be /usr/local/bin.

Steps to install:

./configure --disable-spell
